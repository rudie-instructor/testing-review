/* 
    Write tests for an instructor class that returns objects with three properties; name (string), 
    assistants (empty array) and a method called addAssistant, which takes a single 
    string argument and alters the assistant property accordingly. Also, write tests that verify that 
    a general error is thrown when the instructor class is provided no argument, and specific errors 
    are thrown when the instructor class and its corresponding method property are provided invalid arguments

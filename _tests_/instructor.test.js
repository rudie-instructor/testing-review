    Write tests for an instructor class that returns objects with four properties; name (string), assistants (empty array)
    and two methods called addAssistant and removeAssistant, which both take string arguments and alter the 
    assistant property accordingly. Also, write tests that verify that a general error is thrown when the 
    instructor class is provided no argument, and specific errors are thrown when the instructor class and 
    it's corresponding method properties are provided invalid arguments
